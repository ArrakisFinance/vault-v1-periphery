Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the\n * initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n * constructor() initializer {}\n * ```\n * ====\n */\nabstract contract Initializable {\n    /**\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\n     */\n    bool private _initialized;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\n     */\n    bool private _initializing;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Modifier to protect an initializer function from being invoked twice.\n     */\n    modifier initializer() {\n        // If the contract is initializing we ignore whether _initialized is set in order to support multiple\n        // inheritance patterns, but we only do this in the context of a constructor, because in other contexts the\n        // contract may have been reentered.\n        require(_initializing ? _isConstructor() : !_initialized, \"Initializable: contract is already initialized\");\n\n        bool isTopLevelCall = !_initializing;\n        if (isTopLevelCall) {\n            _initializing = true;\n            _initialized = true;\n        }\n\n        _;\n\n        if (isTopLevelCall) {\n            _initializing = false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Modifier to protect an initialization function so that it can only be invoked by functions with the\n     * {initializer} modifier, directly or indirectly.\n     */\n    modifier onlyInitializing() {\n        require(_initializing, \"Initializable: contract is not initializing\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    function _isConstructor() private view returns (bool) {\n        return !AddressUpgradeable.isContract(address(this));\n    }\n}\n"
